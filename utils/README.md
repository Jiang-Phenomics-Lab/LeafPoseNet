## ðŸ”§ Code Structure Highlights

* ðŸ“‰ **Loss Function Implementation**
  The loss functions used for model training are implemented in [`utils.py`](./utils.py).

* ðŸ”¥ **Keypoint to Heatmap Conversion**

**  A **Gaussian-based method** is adopted to convert keypoints into pseudo-heatmaps.
  This transformation is implemented in the `KeypointToHeatMap` class within [`transforms.py`](./transforms.py).
